### Hi there! I'm Brandon. ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a student at the University of Pennsylvania studying in the Jerome Fisher Program in Management and Technology (M&T). I'm pursuing a B.S.E. in Computer Science and a B.S. in Economics from Wharton. Currently, I'm a DevOps developer at [Penn Labs](http://pennlabs.org/). In the past, I've worked on projects involving web dev, machine learning, and robotics, as well as some ML research at UT Southwestern Medical Center and Stony Brook University.

In my free time, I like playing tennis, hiking, and playing strategy games (Avalon, Catan, etc.) with friends.
