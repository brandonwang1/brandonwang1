### Hi there! I'm Brandon. ğŸ‘‹

I'm currently a student at the University of Pennsylvania, class of 2024. I'm pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.S. in Economics as part of the M&T Program. On campus, I'm a developer at [Penn Labs](http://pennlabs.org/). I've previously interned at tech and trading companies, and I'm interested in systems, networking, and ML.

In my free time, I like playing tennis, hiking, and playing strategy games (Avalon, Catan, etc.) with friends.
