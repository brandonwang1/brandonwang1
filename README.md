### Hi there! I'm Brandon. ðŸ‘‹

I'm a freshman at the University of Pennsylvania ('24) studying in the Jerome Fisher Program in Management and Technology (M&T). I'm pursuing a B.S.E. in Computer Science and a B.S. in Economics from Wharton. In the past, I've worked on projects involving web dev, machine learning, and robotics, as well as a bit of research.

In my free time, I like playing tennis, hiking, and playing strategy games (Avalon, Catan, etc.) with friends. You can reach me at brandw (at) seas.upenn.edu!
